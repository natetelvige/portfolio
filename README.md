# Natalia Lamalfa Portfolio


Hi! I'm Nati, a software development student who loves creating fun and functional projects. Here you'll find a collection of my mini-games, web apps, and programming experiments. I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my skills through hands-on coding. Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to connect!
